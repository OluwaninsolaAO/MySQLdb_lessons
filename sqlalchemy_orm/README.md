Welcome to the SQLAlchemy section of this Github repository! In this section, you will find a detailed lesson plan that will guide you through the process of learning how to use SQLAlchemy.

The lesson plan is organized into several modules, each focusing on a specific aspect of SQLAlchemy. Each module includes a set of exercises and examples that will help you to practice and reinforce the concepts learned in that module.
